Shora will be a home shooting cinema solution for hunters shooters or any other interested person. The main goal is to offer a solution which will be working on linux using open source libraries. 

The main goal is to be able to use your real weapons - with a laser device - or some special laser pointer weapons. There shall also be some self made solutions for future usage, like a adaption of a softair or something like that. 

The main setup will contain a PC, a USB Camera, a beamer, and a laser device for shooting. The beamer will provide the target area, and the camera will take some screenshots of the current scene, and will create a snapshot with the hit on the current target for surveillance. 

The user shall be able to train skeet, trap, or hunting solutions. It is also planed to make a posibility to add custom made movies like the own hunting scene or some views from the shooting range. It could also be possible to use real official targets which could be placed on the wall for shooting practice.
